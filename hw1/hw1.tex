\section*{Problem 1}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $P_t$ is the amount of principal in the account at time $t$. $t$ ranges over the reals.
	\item $P_0$ is the initial principal in the account. $P_0$ ranges over the reals.
	\item $m$ is the number of times the interest is compounded per year. $m$ must be positive.
	\item $j$ is the annual interest rate. One would think that interest must be positive. The recent financial history of the European Union shows that $j$ ranges over the reals.
	\item $t$ is the time in years that the account has been growing. $t$ ranges over the reals.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 2}
I asked in class if you meant that the interest is compounded monthly or yearly here, and you answered yearly. So I proceed to answer accordingly.

$$P_5 = \$1000(1+\frac{0.015}{1})^{5\times 1} = \$1077.28$$

\section*{Problem 3}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $P_5 = \$1000(1+\frac{0.015}{2})^{5\times 2} = \$1077.58$
	\item $P_5 = \$1000(1+\frac{0.015}{4})^{5\times 4} = \$1077.73$
	\item $P_5 = \$1000(1+\frac{0.015}{6})^{5\times 6} = \$1077.78$
	\item $P_5 = \$1000(1+\frac{0.015}{12})^{5\times 12} = \$1077.83$
\end{itemize}

As the frequency with which the interest compounds increases, the total value of the account goes up over the same time period.

\section*{Problem 4}


\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, caption=$P_t$ at different values of $m$]
1 #!/usr/bin/python3.5
2 P_0 = 1000
3 t = 5
4 j = 0.015
5 
6 # iterate over values of m, and print corresponding P_t
7 for m in range(1,100):
8     P_t = P_0*(1+j/m)**(t*m)
9     print("{} {}".format(m,P_t))

\section*{Problems 5 \& 6}
Below, I've plotted the size of an account after 5 years in dollars with an initial
 deposit of \$1000, an annual interest of $j$ compounded $m$ times per year.
 
 It's interesting to note that as $m$ increases, the value of the account seems to 
 approach the continuous compounding amount. Also, $j$ increases the value of the account
 exponentially.

\section*{Problem 8}
Call $f(j) \equiv P_t(j) = P_0(1+\frac{j}{m})^{mt}$. Then 

\newcommand{\dv}[1]{\frac{d}{d#1}}

$$\dv j ln(f(j))=\frac{1}{f(j)}\cdot f'(j)$$

$$\Rightarrow \dv j f(j) = f(j)\cdot \dv{j}ln(f(j))$$

So, we have that

\begin{align*}
\dv j ln(f(j)) &= \dv j ln(P_0(1+\frac{j}{m})^{mt}) \\
	&= mt \dv j [ln P_0 + ln\frac{j}{m}] \\
	&= mt\dv j[ln\; j - ln\; m]\\
	&= mt\dv j ln\; j\\
	&= \frac{mt}{j}
\end{align*}

Hence, $\dv j f(j) = f(j)\cdot \dv j ln\; f(j) = P_0(1+\frac{j}{m})^{mt}\cdot \frac{mt}{j}$

Thus, you would expect an increase in $j$ by $\Delta j$ to
bear about an increase of $\Delta j\cdot P_0(1+\frac{j}{m})^{mt}\cdot \frac{mt}{j}$ in $P_t$.

\section*{Problem 9}
We have

\begin{align*}
1000e^{rt} &= 1000\cdot(1+\frac{0.015}{12})^{12t} \\
\Rightarrow e^{rt} &= 1.00125^{12t} \\
\Rightarrow rt &= 12t\cdot ln\; 1.00125 \\
\Rightarrow r &= 12\cdot ln\;1.00125\approx 0.01499
\end{align*}
